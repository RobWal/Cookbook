# Jaunt website

## Technologies Used:

-   Python, Flask, Postgres, Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Approach Taken:

This project was tackled as a proof of concept for a client looking for a customizable landing page for people interested in their table top role playing game, Jaunt. The features presented are the skeleton for what could be implemented, neither the information presented about characters or the layout of the page had input from the client so both were left basic to allow for easy change in direction, however, it shows what's possible.

## Unsolved Problems:

There were no unsolved problems, however, unimplemented features include public access to other users' characters, meetup pages where certain characters appear alongside others for quick and easy updating for online play, as well as more in depth pages to teach players and guides alike, the ins and outs of Jaunt.

## Installation Instructions:

This website can be installed relatively easily using a server to host the files and the database, the project is currently being hosted by Heroku and is available at github:
